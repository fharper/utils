# Utils

A script with different utilities, which is mostly a way for me to do things in the terminal easily.

It started as a repository for a bunch of bash or Zsh scripts (most of them not committed yet), but ended up being only [utils.zsh](utils.zsh) in which I slowly merge them all in one big super duper utilities script.
