# Utils

A script with different utilities, which is mostly a way for me to do things in the terminal easily.

It started as a repository for a bunch of bash or Zsh scripts (most of them not committed yet), but ended up being only [pdfutils.sh](pdfutils.sh), but I will eventually merge [pdfutils.sh](pdfutils.sh), and the other one I never updated to add here into one big super duper mega utility scripts, [utils.zsh](utils.zsh).
